https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/pages/research-opportunities-0,Advising,Y,Civil and Environmental Engineering,1:58,One way to get involved in research with graduate students and sponsoring PS Faculty is to approach them. Be prepared to talk about your coursework and interests and be sure to ask about their current research. Most students approach professors in courses they have enjoyed and done well in. The best time for students to approach professors and graduate students is during their office hours and after class. Email also works well. See the faculty's Research Opportunities webpage for any currently available positions but do not be afraid to approach or contact them directly even if they may not have any available positions.,62.48,8.8,22,6,103,0.85,0.3111111111111111
