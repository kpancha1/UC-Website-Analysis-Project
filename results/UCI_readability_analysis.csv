The advisor will be a member of the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry faculty group, and will assist the students in choosing elective courses tailored to their interests.",6.03,18.1,36,4,91,0.7717,0.08392857142857144

This program of study prepares students for careers in science, research, or technical fields. Students learn to apply basic sciences (physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biology) to understand the major processes and systems governing the Earthâs climate, biogeochemical cycles, and global change. Central to the Earth System Science (B.S.) program is an understanding of relevant scientific literature, methods to collect/analyze data, and interpret results in the context of scientific theory. Students learn to work collaboratively to understand and address complex problems and communicate scientific knowledge. Through the core course work, students learn to explain the current and projected future state of the Earth system in the context of past climate change and current human activities. Once the core course work is complete, students are encouraged to focus on a particular area within Earth System Science and to choose electives that build a coherent core of knowledge.",35.98,12.8,55,9,165,-0.0516,0.04527777777777778
