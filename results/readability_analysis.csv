This residential energy expenditure gap persists after controlling for income, household size, home-owner status, and city of residence. It decreased but did not disappear between 2010 and 2017, and it is fairly stable in levels across the income distribution, except at the top. Controlling for home type or vintage does not eliminate the gap, but survey evidence on housing characteristics and available appliances is consistent with the gap being driven at least in part by differences in housing stock and related energy efficiency investments.This seminar series is put on by the UC Berkeley Rausser College of Natural Resources (RCNR) and the Berkeley Environmental Economics and Policy Students (BEEPS).RSVP for this event via CalLinkfor the Zoom Information!https://callink.berkeley.edu/event/6564959",30.7,14.8,16.4,16.0,17.4,15.32,11.44,14.8,57,8,188,0.9544,Positive

Parallel to this, we will look at the work of nominally non-commercial artists and try to understand how they appropriated and deployed the visual culture of consumer society.

https://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/courses/,"The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle described the virtuous friend as “another self.” More than two-thousand years later, The Rembrandts sang of a good friend, “[it] seems you’re the only one who knows / What it’s like to be me.” (And so, they continued, “I’ll be there for you / ‘Cause you’re there for me too.”) This course suggests we take both of these reflections on friendship seriously and consider friendship as a means to approaching the study of American culture and history. Our interdisciplinary examination of friendship will explore both the lived experience of being a friend and the ways in which popular culture and the media have depicted friendship in the United States, past and present. We will consider, for example, the folklore and anthropology of friendship; the shifting line between friendship and romantic love; consumerism and friendship; ethnic, racial, and generational differences among friendship cultures; institutions rooted in friendship (such as fraternities and sororities); famous friendships on film and television; and how the meaning of friendship has changed over time. By focusing on friendship as a theory, a fantasy, an organization, an event, and a media construct, this course provides an introduction to and a “toolkit” for the interdisciplinary study of American culture.",42.04,14.6,15.5,16.72,19.1,13.94,9.74,12.8,47,7,203,0.9959,Positive

Marvin Gaye tackled drug abuse, environmental destruction, and the Vietnam War onWhat’s Going On, often considered the greatest album of all time, while Sly and the Family Stone incorporated elements of the Black Power movement into their music. Carole King and Joni Mitchell told stories about love, sexuality, and (in)dependence in the modern world onTapestryandBlue, two pinnacles of the singer-songwriter genre. In February, Aretha Franklin recorded one of the most iconic live albums ever in San Francisco (Aretha Live at Fillmore West); in April, Dolly Parton recorded her favorite original song (“Coat of Many Colors.”) Miles Davis continued his quest to expand the boundaries of what jazz could be, while experimentalists Morton Feldman and Pauline Oliveros did the same for classical music. In this course we will become intimately familiar with all of this music and more, as we consider both what the music reveals about the United States in 1971 and why it reverberates so powerfully over a half-century later.

Thus, conceptually whereas an earlier generation of radical academics may have asked if liberation is to be found in a working-class revolution or in an uprising of the “wretched of the earth,” the concept of racial capitalism offers an ongoing synthesis by refusing to accept the antinomy of racial versus class formations, setting out instead their dynamic interrelation.",10.91,22.4,21.2,25.34,25.1,13.88,11.83,23.333333333333332,59,4,172,0.7506,Positive

https://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/courses/,"As one writer quipped, it was the worst of times, it was the worst of times. “The Seventies” routinely come in for mockery as an era of bad taste — an era when enormous sideburns, leisure suits, extra-wide bell bottoms, pet rocks, and “diet” mackerel pudding made sense to all too many Americans. Even at the time, the 1970s were known as the decade when “it seemed like nothing happened.” Yet we can see now that the ’70s was a time of great cultural renaissance and political ferment. Cultural historian Thomas Hine calls the decade “the great funk” because it was a time when America was both out-of-sorts and bursting with new energies. The ’70s gave us the New Hollywood of Scorcese, Coppola and others; the “New Journalism” of Michael Herr, Joan Didion, and others; the music of funk, disco, punk and New Wave; the postmodern comedy of Saturday Night Live and the postmodern drama of Off-Off-Broadway; and a great range of literary fiction written by women authors from Ursula LeGuin and Margaret Atwood to Toni Morrison and Maxine Hong Kingston. Rather than simply being a transitional period between the “liberal” 1960s and “conservative” 1980s, the ’70s were in fact a period of intense political realignment, with the United States roiled by the oil crisis, the fall of Nixon and the fall of Saigon; by the advent of women’s liberation, gay liberation, and environmentalism as mass grassroots movements; and by the rise of the Sunbelt and the dawning of the conservative revolution. One might even say that the ’70s were the most interesting decade of the post-WWII era — the period when the freedom dreams of the ‘60s were most intensely fulfilled even as a resurgent conservative movement challenged their underlying vision. Lastly, the ’70s may be the 20th-c. decade closest to our own contemporary moment. We will consider how the roots of our current predicament lie in the earlier decade — with its backlash against movements for racial justice and gender equality, its gun culture, its corruption of the political process, its suspicion of the state, its transition to a postindustrial economy, its widening inequality, its fetish for self-fulfillment, and its fascination with the appeal of instant celebrity.

This course is designed to explore baseball over time and across, for both students who love the sport and those who are mystified by its appeal. Lectures focus on the way baseball has acquired cultural meaning in the various settings where it has thrived as a spectator sport, both in the United States and in other nations, since the middle of the nineteenth century. We will pay special attention to baseball’s place in larger developments in the history of urban space, gender, media, labor, statistics, racial inequality, international relations, and U.S. empire. Requirements include regular attendance at lectures, timely completion of reading assignments, an in-class mid-term examination, a short (500–600 words) analysis of primary source documents, a longer (800–900 words) analysis of a pair of novels, and a final examination.",33.28,15.9,17.3,18.31,19.5,14.46,11.64,17.0,57,6,176,0.9719,Positive

Since the moment we’ve stepped on campus, we have all in some way been truly inspired by the University of California. This course will dive into the rich history, remarkable spirit, and spectacular traditions of Cal from its founding in 1868 to the present-day. We will touch on the origins of the Stanford Axe, the Free Speech Movement, and even some current events at the University. Our hope is that this course will allow you to love and appreciate Cal even more.

https://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/courses/,"During the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, UC Berkeley was more than just California’s flagship public university. It became a potent and often powerful cultural symbol. To invoke Berkeley or Cal became shorthand for academic excellence, or transformative student activism, or radical politics, or the devastating power of nuclear war. But when the university was founded over one hundred and fifty years ago, it was, simply, the University of California: California’s first land grant university, tasked with the responsibility of educating the people of the country’s then-westernmost state. Yet from its inception, the University of California’s purpose was fraught, contested, and contingent. The founding Organic Act proclaimed that the state would build this new university on “donat[ed] land” that was granted “to the State of California under and by the provisions of an Act of Congress”—yet this land was composed of over 2,300 uncompensated Indigenous land parcels.

Since the country’s founding in the late eighteenth century, the body has been the site of both metaphorical and physical contestations over American identity. Human bodies and body parts—from skin to skulls to bellies to hair—have marked the boundaries and constitutive components of American political and cultural citizenship. Americans have both policed and regulated each other’s bodies and used their own bodies to claim or proclaim their place in the body politic; as poet Lucille Clifton wrote in 1980, “these hips / are free hips. / they don’t like to be held back. / these hips have never been enslaved, / they go where they want to go / they do what they want to do.”",67.08,9.1,12.5,12.21,12.5,10.56,8.94,16.5,24,6,126,0.8252,Positive

As tensions between the North and South worsened and the nation descended into a devastating Civil War, ordinary people living across North America continued to live daily lives saturated with objects: they exchanged coins and bank notes, sewed clothing, prepared meals, mailed letters, used tools, shot guns, and cared for dead and dying bodies. While the objects themselves may have differed, people across the country depended on and drew from meaning from their stuff— whether they were enslaved families in South Carolina, immigrant neighborhoods in San Francisco, white middle-class families in Boston, or Indigenous communities on the Great Plains.

What is the culture of the beach, and why does it matter? By combining history, material culture, and popular media (including literature, music, and film), as well as visits to local Bay Area beaches, our interdisciplinary study of the beach will consider what American beaches can teach us about race, ethnicity, gender, indigeneity, class, sexuality, work, leisure, consumption, the environment, popular culture, and power in the United States.

https://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/courses/,"As an academic discipline, American Studies takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of US culture in all its forms. From music to architecture, from literature to advertising, American Studies has broken down the distinctions between art and politics, labor and leisure, fine arts and popular culture. Throughout its history, American Studies has pushed the boundaries of academic inquiry by placing questions of race, class, gender and sexuality, power and resistance into the center of our inquiry, pressing what was once the margins of American life into the center of this dynamic and radical field. Yet, as the founder of Cultural Studies Raymond Williams reminds us, culture is one of the most complex words in the English language, encompassing a range of meanings from the anthropological to the biological to the aesthetic. Therefore, in this course we will take up the question of culture and theories of culture within American Studies by reading both classical works and new directions in cultural theory.

In this class, we will closely examine the objects that were part of everyday life in the United States in the middle of the 19th century (approximately 1846 to 1877). As tensions between the North and South worsened and the nation descended into a devastating Civil War, ordinary people living across North America continued to live daily lives saturated with objects: they exchanged coins and bank notes, sewed clothing, prepared meals, mailed letters, used tools, shot guns, and cared for dead and dying bodies. While the objects themselves may have differed, people across the country depended on and drew from meaning from their stuff— whether they were enslaved families in South Carolina, immigrant neighborhoods in San Francisco, white middle-class families in Boston, or Indigenous communities on the Great Plains. By combining the methodology and sources of material culture with examinations of history and popular media, our interdisciplinary study of American stuff will consider what objects can teach us about culture, identity, and community in the shadow of war, and the lessons we can draw for our twenty-first century world.

Using historical and cultural studies methods to study the recent past, we will take on the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and cultural changes that have remade American life in the past two decades. This era has led us to a state of almost permanent crisis in which our democracy, our health and sanity, our jobs and relationships, and our planet all feel on the verge of collapse. Primary topics include the long war on terrorism, the ongoing crisis of global capitalism, race and the culture wars of the Obama era, America’s widening political polarization and the impact of climate change on our bodies, landscapes and culture. Throughout, we will read histories, journalism and novels, listen to popular music, watch important films and TV shows, and generally reconsider the history of a past that we have all somehow survived and must continue to live through.

We’ll also explore works of music, film, and theater that, like Obama’s autobiography, rewrote the romance of America—whether by adding hip-hop accents to the story of the country’s founding (Hamilton), turning a story of interracial romance into a horror tale (Get Out), or creating an Afro-futurist, queer-inflected story of slave revolt (Janelle Monáe’s Metropolis saga).

Marvin Gaye tackled drug abuse, environmental destruction, and the Vietnam War on What’s Going On, often considered the greatest album of all time, while Sly and the Family Stone incorporated elements of the Black Power movement into their music. Carole King and Joni Mitchell told stories about love, sexuality, and (in)dependence in the modern world on Tapestry and Blue, two pinnacles of the singer-songwriter genre. In February, Aretha Franklin recorded one of the most iconic live albums ever in San Francisco (Aretha Live at Fillmore West); in April, Dolly Parton recorded her favorite original song (“Coat of Many Colors”). Miles Davis continued his quest to expand the boundaries of what jazz could be, while experimentalists Morton Feldman and Pauline Oliveros did the same for classical music. In this course we will become intimately familiar with all of this music and more, as we consider both what the music reveals about the United States in 1971, and why it reverberates so powerfully over a half-century later.

This decade was defined by crisis after crisis, from the economic hardships of the Great Depression, to political protest and deep labor unrest, to vast ecological disaster and the seeming demise of democracy around the globe. Despite this—or perhaps because of this—the period was rich in technological, cultural, and social development. How did this decade of crisis help form a new kind of modernity, one that continues to reverberate in our world today? Our task is to try and answer this question. To do so, we will examine the material and representational cultures of the period, such as new technologies of the era (both imagined and realized), popular entertainments (music, novels, and Hollywood films), the arts (folk arts, handicrafts, and the “fine” arts); and examples of the work of planners, architects, and industrial designers (consumer products, buildings, even whole cities both built and unbuilt).

The threat of nuclear annihilation, the rise of anti-Communist ideology, the development of a powerful military-industrial complex, the reliance on covert and proxy warfare, the intersection of civil rights and foreign policy, changing family dynamics and postwar sexuality, civil defense and social engineering programs, and the Hollywood movie monsters that reveal how deeply nuclear preoccupations penetrated the mass culture of the nation are among the topics this course will consider. A central question of the course is: how did the bomb challenge old assumptions and compel reconsideration of accepted norms? Our task in this course is to figure out how people used and responded to the rhetoric of progress and annihilation in the United States. We will study a variety of literary and visual media, and research scientific and political publications, aesthetic and artistic movements, and spectacular public events.",30.74,16.9,16.9,19.0,19.6,13.65,11.08,23.0,56,6,191,-0.3182,Negative

https://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/courses/,"Classical music was big business in the United States in the years preceding the First World War, but not for American composers. As audiences flocked to performances of music by European composers, the most famous work of “American” classical music was not American at all: Czech composer Antonín Dvořák’s New World Symphony. But all that would soon change. Over the course of the 1920s and 30s, a new wave of composers redefined what American classical music could be by responding to the distinctly American experiences of their time. Black composers like Florence Price and William Grant Still blended symphonic forms with blues and spirituals. “Ultra-modern” composers like Ruth Crawford Seeger and (UC Berkeley alum) Henry Cowell wrote radical music to match their increasingly radical politics. And Aaron Copland crafted what would become known as a quintessentially American sound, but only after drawing inspiration from the folk-music-infused works of Mexican composer Carlos Chávez.",49.45,11.8,15.2,13.68,15.5,13.98,10.11,13.8,34,7,152,0.93,Positive

We’ll also explore works of music, film, and theater that, like Obama’s autobiography, rewrote the romance of America—whether, say, by adding hip-hop accents to the story of the country’s founding (Hamilton), turning a story of interracial romance into a horror tale(Get Out), or creating an Afro-futurist, queer-inflected story of slave revolt (Janelle Monáe’s Metropolis saga). Along the way, we’ll consider two of the social movements that coalesced and gathered force during Obama’s presidency: Occupy and Black Lives Matter. We’ll investigate how these movements challenged the limits—political, economic, moral—of the “age of Obama” through art and political action, and looked to create new forms of radical community while protesting inequality and state violence",28.3,17.8,17.1,19.53,22.6,14.92,11.65,16.75,62,6,205,0.8779,Positive

English colonies will emerge as part of a larger international system, one comprised of Spanish, Dutch, and French colonies, and, especially, of the scores of indigenous polities that controlled most of the continent for most of the period we’ll be studying.

Are we outliving the Negro Fad?” Implicit in each of these positions are a set of questions about the nature of identity, art, modernism, progress, which point to the dilemma as defined by W.E.B.

What was distinctive about Black art? What gave it such broad, international appeal? Could art be used to uplift the conditions of a people? Were Black artists obligated to make their art a means of protest against racism? If they were, would they produce art or propaganda?

Less than two hundred years ago, the U.S. was just starting to transform itself from a country of farmers and village craftsmen into a nation based on large scale, mechanized, corporate controlled industry. It is now an industrial colossus dominated by huge multinational corporations that operate in markets around the world. Its leaders are experiencing many forms of disruptive innovation. They must manage, find economic opportunities, and politically maneuver in a marketplace that is being constantly shaped and reshaped by international competition, technological and financial innovation, and the ever insistent demands from the investor community for maximal profits every quarter. They must also deal with new forms of financial, economic, social, and environmental regulation, here and abroad, as well as the ongoing rise of new generations of dynamic competitors in China, India, and other parts of the developing world. How has American business gotten to where it is today? How can historical insight help us understand the strategic, organizational, geo-political, economic, social, and environmental problems, opportunities and challenges facing todays corporate managers?

In this class, we will closely examine the objects that were part of everyday life in the United States in the middle of the nineteenth century (approximately 1846 to 1877). As tensions between the North and South worsened and the nation descended into a devastating Civil War, ordinary people living across North America continued to live daily lives saturated with objects: they exchanged coins and bank notes, sewed clothing, prepared meals, mailed letters, used tools, purchased medicines and cosmetics, shot guns, and cared for dead and dying bodies. While the objects themselves may have differed, people across the country depended on and drew from meaning from their stuff—whether they were enslaved families in South Carolina, immigrant neighborhoods in San Francisco, white middle-class families in Boston, or native communities on the Great Plains.

In this class, we will closely examine the objects that were part of everyday life in the United States in the middle of the nineteenth century (approximately 1846 to 1877). As tensions between the North and South worsened and the nation descended into a devastating Civil War, ordinary people living across North America continued to live daily lives saturated with objects: they exchanged coins and bank notes, sewed clothing, prepared meals, mailed letters, used tools, purchased medicines and cosmetics, shot guns, and cared for dead and dying bodies. While the objects themselves may have differed, people across the country depended on and drew from meaning from their stuff—whether they were enslaved families in South Carolina, immigrant neighborhoods in San Francisco, white middle-class families in Boston, or native communities on the Great Plains.

Barnum, deception seemed to lurk around every corner, and many Americans felt increasingly anxious about their ability—or inability—to tell truth from fiction. Our examination of American scams will focus especially on the middle decades of the nineteenth century (1830–1870), an era during which the nation’s population tripled, Barnum opened his American Museum in New York City, and Herman Melville published his final novel, The Confidence-Man.

https://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/courses/,"This is a course on the literature of incarceration variously defined and experienced across a range of control systems that attempt to stunt the entire human being. I want to think about the forms of suppression, confinement, and the humiliations of control systems imposed not only on the body but on the mind and heart by the “new” prison system. We will want to concentrate on the ways human beings find the strength to survive conditions of subjection to voice their intellectual, emotional, and spiritual presence. We will open with theorizations of incarceration: chapters from Foucault’s Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison; perhaps chapters from Reiman and Leighton’s The Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Prison; letters from George Jackson’s Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters. We will study documentary film on the steep, orchestrated rise in incarceration and the politics of prison as a racial, ethnic, gendered, class control system (13th; Babies Behind Bars; Broken on All Sides). We will read prison narrative/poetry—Jimmy Santiago Baca’s memoir/poetry (A Place to Stand), Kenneth Hartman’s autobiography (Mother California)—and women’s prison poetry and memoir (Wall Tappings), but we will also consider other forms of incarceration: Latinas incarcerated in the “domestic sphere” in Cisneros’ House on Mango Street or the tale of an affluent white woman driven to insanity, or perhaps an alternate sanity, in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s The Yellow Wallpaper. We will consider the forms of incarceration entire communities have been subjected to en masse: Native Americans dispossessed of their tribal homes, imprisoned for resisting or writing about their confinement in U.S. society; tens of thousands of Japanese Americans (loyal Americans) sent to detention centers during WWII (Wakatsuki’s Farewell to Manzanar); thousands of Chinese immigrants who, often detained for long periods at Angel Island (in San Francisco Bay), carved poems of rage, loneliness, imagined retribution on the wood barrack walls of their “prison” in the early 20th century. In addition to textual forms of expression, I hope also to survey some of the films, art, and photography of/on incarceration.

As the semester progresses, we will seek out the sources of this dramatic transformation, exploring a variety of overlapping and sometimes conflicting explanations. Is this primarily a story about ideas and economic outlook? Is it about entrepreneurship and innovation? Or about exploitation and expropriation? What role did the government play? What role the individual? Major themes will include the rise of the factory system, slavery and emancipation, immigration and labor, the development of banking and finance, and economic inequality. In addition to building their knowledge of American history, students will gain theoretical familiarity with three subfields of history: business history, economic history, and labor history. We will explore the ways each of these fields has generated different narratives that celebrate and/or critique American capitalism.

Students will investigate—in both theory and practice—the capacity of art making to cultivate transformation of themselves, their relationships, their practices, their institutions, and the larger economic and socio-political structures in which they function, locally and globally. Focusing on historical and contemporary artists and political issues, we ask: 1) How is art impacted by social change? 2) How has art been used toward social change? and 3) How can we, as course participants, use art to bring about social change? Rooted in interdisciplinary scholarship, students will engage theoretical debates and historical analyses regarding the role of the arts in social change and examine the particular capacities of the arts to negotiate across and between cultures, languages, and power-laden lines of difference. Taking a broad view of activism, we will consider the ways in which artistic practices foster radical imaginations that can expand our sense of the possible.

What role the individual? Major themes will include the rise of the factory system, slavery and emancipation, immigration and labor, the development of banking and finance, and economic inequality.

It all depends on where you sit and what your own private score is. I didn’t have one. I didn’t care. –Raymond Chandler, The Long Goodbye 1953Taking shape and definition in the late 1930s and the first years of the 1940s, when the United States was more than ten years into the Great Depression and the Second World War was either imminent or had already begun, and continuing into the early 1960s, noir was a sensibility and a way of being in the world. It was a critique, an attitude, a mood, a language, and aesthetic of alienation where cynicism was part of a moral code and fatalism a part of democratic faith and it was expressed, developed, and tested at the margins of legitimate cultural discourse: in low-budget or Poverty Row Hollywood movies, crime fiction, and TV police and detective dramas. In this course we will discuss such still-stunning films as Double Indemnity, Detour, and Sunset Boulevard alongside such indelible novels as Raymond Chandlers Farewell, My Lovely, Ross Macdonalds The Way Some People Die, Chester Himess If He Hollers Let Him Go, and Jim Thompsons Nothing More Than Murder, and the prescient as-it-happened film criticism of Manny Farber. Our goal is to explore, as noir artists did, an America within America and to illuminate noir within its historical period, to understand why it arose and how it dramatized specific wartime and postwar American traumas about citizenship, gender relations, the reintegration of millions of soldiers into peacetime society, abundance, corruption, and the fear of enemies from abroad and within.

Less than two hundred years ago, the U.S. was just starting to transform itself from a country of farmers and village craftsmen into a nation based on large scale, mechanized, corporate controlled industry. By the late 20th century the nation was an industrial colossus dominated by huge multinational corporations that operated in markets around the world. Now its corporations are experiencing many forms of disruptive innovation, and its richly paid executives are dealing with a wide range of new national and international challenges. They must manage, find economic opportunities, and politically maneuver in a marketplace that is being constantly shaped and reshaped by international competition, technological and financial innovation, the ever insistent demands from the investor community for maximal profits every quarter, and new forms of financial, economic, social, and environmental regulation, here and abroad, as well as the ongoing rise of new generations of dynamic competitors in China, India, and other parts of the developing world.How has American business gotten to where it is today? How can historical insight help us understand the strategic, organizational, geo-political, economic, social, and environmental challenges facing the managers of todays global businesses?

As the semester progresses, we will seek out the sources of this dramatic transformation, exploring a variety of overlapping and sometimes conflicting explanations. Is this primarily a story about ideas and economic outlook? Is it about entrepreneurship and innovation? Or about exploitation and expropriation? What role did the government play? What role the individual? Major themes will include the rise of the factory system, slavery and emancipation, immigration and labor, the development of banking and finance, and economic inequality.In addition to building their knowledge of American history, students will gain theoretical familiarity with three subfields of history: business history, economic history, and labor history. We will explore the ways each of these fields has generated different narratives that celebrate and/or critique American capitalism. And at every turn we will consider how these different narratives alternately highlight and minimize the important roles played by business elites, enslaved people, laborers, women, and immigrants.

The region was ground-zero for the revolution in cooking known as California cuisine; ground-zero for new forms of spiritual practice and religious organization; ground-zero for the technological utopianism represented by the Whole Earth Catalog and the computer clubs that produced the first desktop computer; and ground-zero for social movements such as women’s liberation, black liberation, gay liberation, and the environmental movement, and for the new cultural forms that were entangled with them, such as disco, punk, and alternative comix.Second, the course offers students an introduction to the practice of archival research. Our class will explore specific archives at Cal, such as the Chez Panisse Collection, the Berkeley Free Church Collection, the Social Protest Collection, and the Disability Rights and Defense Fund Collection. Students will be asked to explore these sorts of official archives, and will be invited, if they’re interested, to curate their own unofficial archives. You will be approaching these collections with the open eyes of historians looking at fresh documents, and with the goal of plumbing these documents for the insights and stories that they yield.Third, the course will give students the experience of creating digital history projects of their own, as part of the larger Berkeley Revolution project.

Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality?

https://as.ugis.berkeley.edu/courses/,"The place of the actor in the theatrical event has evolved over the centuries, and some of the most revolutionary changes in the US took place in the 1960s, when society itself was undergoing dramatic upheaval. Theater and performance became urgent sites of political and social commentary. The avant-garde and experimental theater movement that began in the late 1950s and extended into the 1970s drastically reconsidered the theaters role in society, its relationship to the audience, and how acting itself should function. Theater collectives formed, devising works together; rigorous attention was given to movement and voice; theatrical space was re-imagined; minority voices took center stage. Many theater makers were activists for these new approaches, among them Joseph Chaikin, founder of the Open Theater, whose seminal 1972 book The Presence of the Actor, gives this class its name. Though striking and unsettling performances like the Open Theaters The Serpent, or the Living Theaters Paradise Now! may have seemed to arrive out of nowhere, seeds had been planted by the politically, artistically and methodologically provocative work of European theorists such as Brecht, Artaud, and Grotowski, who saw acting in entirely new ways. Taken together with American avant-garde experiments beginning in the 1930s by the likes of John Cage and Merce Cunningham, which questioned the nature of art itself, these practitioners laid the groundwork for twentieth century innovation in western theater and performance. They blurred lines between genres, introduced new kinds of voices and techniques, and challenged once comfortable barriers between character and self, performer and audience, stage and street, text and object, narrative and abstraction, art and real life. Collectives, and individual playwrights and performers, such as the Living Theater and the Open Theater, the San Francisco Mime Troupe, El Teatro Campesino, the Wooster Group, At the Foot of the Mountain, Amiri Baraka, Meredith Monk and Rachel Rosenthal each driven by new and particular priorities on theater, culture, and the performative act altered our understanding of the theatrical experience and its relationship to the world at large. Weekly readings, screenings, lectures, and group discussions will be used to grasp this fascinating period, and help students understand how the country’s social and political history, and these aesthetic innovations, were inseparable.

Hamilton invited James Madison (who became the fourth President of the U.S.) and John Jay to write the others. Hamilton and Madison offer various arguments to try to convince citizens that the newly designed Constitution for a federal government should be accepted and ratified by the state of New York and beyond. Do they convince you? As Jay notes in #2, this new constitution is to be recommended and debated. Such a plan for a federal constitution for a free people who understand the need of a government has to be argued for, because there was already a government of the Continental Congress that seemed to some as working very well. Discussion and debate belong intimately to such a republic, esp. a liberal republic. We cannot read and discuss all of the 85 papers, but we can look carefully at a few of them and engage in discussion and debate. Obviously, the papers deal with serious and controversial issues.

The region was ground-zero for the technological utopianism represented by the Whole Earth Catalog and the computer clubs that produced the first desktop computer; ground-zero for the revolution in cooking known as California cuisine; ground-zero for new forms of spiritual practice and religious organization; ground-zero for the spread of women’s liberation, black liberation and gay liberation, and for the evolution of movement cultures that stood behind such new cultural forms as disco, punk, and alternative comix; and much more.Second, the course offers students an introduction to the practice of archival research. The course will be meeting at the Bancroft Library, and students will work in collaboration with one another to explore specific archives at the Bancroft, such as the Chez Panisse Collection and the Disability Rights and Defense Fund Collection. Students will approach these collections with the open eyes of historians looking at fresh documents, and with the goal of plumbing these documents for the insights and stories that they yield.Third, the course will give students the experience of creating a digital history project of their own.

The region was ground-zero for the technological utopianism represented by the Whole Earth Catalog and the computer clubs that produced the first desktop computer; ground-zero for the revolution in cooking known as California cuisine; ground-zero for new forms of spiritual practice and religious organization; ground-zero for the spread of women’s liberation, black liberation and gay liberation, and for the evolution of movement cultures that stood behind such new cultural forms as disco, punk, and alternative comix; and much more.Second, the course offers students an introduction to the practice of archival research. The course will be meeting at the Bancroft Library, and students will work in collaboration with one another to explore specific archives at the Bancroft, such as the Chez Panisse Collection and the Disability Rights and Defense Fund Collection. Students will approach these collections with the open eyes of historians looking at fresh documents, and with the goal of plumbing these documents for the insights and stories that they yield.Third, the course will give students the experience of creating a digital history project of their own. Students will work towards creating both a digital exhibition and a multi-media essay that springs out of the primary research they do.

We explore a wide variety of music from this period, including African American freedom songs, soul, jazz, and funk; the multiracial folk revival; Asian American jazz and taiko; and various Latino styles. In what ways did these social movements employ culture as a political tool? How was music used to express discontent and look toward a better future? In order to address these questions and more, we will engage readings on music, politics, history, and identity. We will also view, listen, and perform the traditions we study.

The other is as discussion section leader in one of the Department’s lower-division lecture courses such as “Introduction to Greek Civilization” or “The Classic Myths”; in these assignments, GSIs coordinate closely with the faculty member teaching the course in conducting discussion sections, developing assignments, and grading and commenting on exams and papers.

Since the emergence of ethnic studies as an academic field in the late 1960s, scholars have analyzed the ways in which race and racism have been, and continue to be, powerful social, cultural, and political forces and their connections to other axes of stratification, including gender, class, sexuality, and legal status. Our faculty utilize a range of humanities and social science methodologies to analyze the production and effects of race and indigeneity. Some of our faculty focus on one racial group and geographic area while others work comparatively and transnationally.  Collectively our research and teaching provide a comparative framework for understanding particular racialized and indigenous groups as well as the relationships among them.",24.71,17.1,17.8,19.92,19.9,15.44,11.54,24.0,52,5,147,0.2023,Positive

After these two introductory experiences, I felt more confident in my abilities as a researcher, and attended the physics and astronomy research fairs at the start of each semester of my sophomore year. From the fair, I emailed one of the presenters, and subsequently got my position working under Antonella Palmese and Saul Perlmutter on gravitational wave cosmology.

The same year, I took the Python for Astronomers DeCal, and did a project on creating Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for several star clusters. After these two introductory experiences, I felt more confident in my abilities as a researcher, and attended the physics and astronomy research fairs at the start of each semester of my sophomore year. From the fair, I emailed one of the presenters, and subsequently got my position working under Antonella Palmese and Saul Perlmutter on gravitational wave cosmology. Having started this position in the spring, I decided to apply for the Pi2 scholars summer program, and was accepted to the program to work with Antonella as my mentor, continuing the work we started in the spring. I also joined ULAB staff as a lab manager in my sophomore year, and I am now research director for the DeCal, helping other undergraduates get their first research experience like I once did.

Astronomy was initially taught by George Davidson, natural scientist and chief of the Pacific Division of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, soon followed by Frank Soule, who taught mathematics, civil engineering, and astronomy. Soule led the astronomy program for about two decades until the early 1890s, when he assigned teaching to Armin O. Leuschner, a mathematics instructor. Leuschner went on to head the department until 1938. During his tenure, Astronomy at Berkeley achieved distinction in the field, particularly by producing graduate students and for work on the discovery and computation of orbits of comets and “minor planets” (commonly known as asteroids today).",36.59,12.6,14.3,13.53,13.8,13.92,10.88,10.142857142857142,37,7,124,0.3612,Positive

We believe academic strength comes not only from our integrative approach to the study of biology, but also from having a faculty whose breadth of scientific interests and methodological approaches span dimensions across the biological sciences. Our teaching at the graduate and undergraduate levels emphasizes the development of critical thinking skills. We nurture these skills across a wide spectrum of courses — from large enrollment courses to small classroom, laboratory, and field settings — where students and faculty are partners in discovery.

https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-research,"Our department provides a variety of channels for students to get involved with real scientific research early in their careers. Through research, you will strengthen your physics background knowledge by applying it to real problems and develop crucial skills needed for careers in science and industry, such as collaboration, independent problem-solving, and communication. Though your role will vary from lab to lab, as an undergraduate, you can typically expect to assist with a variety of tasks, ranging from simulation and data analysis to operating and tuning lab equipment. While the idea of engaging in cutting-edge research as a college student may seem daunting, many research groups will organize projects specifically tailored to undergraduates, and you will often be put under the mentorship of a senior graduate student or a postdoctoral scholar who will be more than willing to assist you. Overall, participating in undergraduate research is an extremely fulfilling experience, and we highly encourage you to participate in it!",22.28,18.1,17.1,19.51,20.7,14.92,11.27,16.75,53,5,159,0.7082,Positive

https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-research,"As a freshman coming into UC Berkeley with no previous experience in research or astronomy, I joined ULAB, after learning about it in my physics class, and had my first research experience working on determining cosmic distances from gravitational waves, previously knowing nothing on the topic. The same year, I took the Python for Astronomers DeCal, and did a project on creating Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for several star clusters. After these two introductory experiences, I felt more confident in my abilities as a researcher, and attended the physics and astronomy research fairs at the start of each semester of my sophomore year. From the fair, I emailed one of the presenters, and subsequently got my position working under Antonella Palmese and Saul Perlmutter on gravitational wave cosmology.

https://physics.berkeley.edu/welcome,"The Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley has a rich history of scientific innovation. Our research continues to advance the frontiers of human knowledge across the full spectrum of our discipline, covering size and energy scales that describe particles smaller than the atom to blackholes and stellar objects that span the extent of the universe itself. The journey today combines cutting-edge research efforts—in both experimental and theoretical physics—housed within individual laboratories across the Physics complex as well as collaborations distributed across the many international centers of excellence and multi-disciplinary institutes anchored in the Department.There is a vibrancy in our Department that is palpable. Its origin lies in the synergy that emerges when a community of scholars and supporters, committed to excellence and equity, engage in open dialogue. A walk through our halls will reveal undergraduates both listening to lectures and also performing laboratory research, side-by-side with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who travel to the Bay Area from all over the globe to be a part of the Berkeley Physics family.As we look forward to the days ahead, we must develop new facilities and methods of pedagogy tailored for the information-age. Such infrastructure is critically needed to support the demanding requirements of precision laboratory science, to attract the next generation of the scientific avant-garde to Berkeley, and to provide safe spaces for discussion and the seamless dissemination of knowledge.  To succeed in these ambitious endeavors, we need the support of our community at large. As a public university that draws the best minds from every corner of the Earth, I am confident that together we can push the boundary of what is possible.Fiat Lux,Irfan Siddiqi",28.88,15.5,16.5,17.17,17.9,15.21,10.91,18.25,91,11,278,0.9922,Positive

Initially, considerable controversy developed as to whether the program should be in the College of Engineering or the College of Chemistry. For a while, this led to the amusing situation where Berkeley had two chemical engineering departments—one housed in the College of Engineering and the other in the College of Chemistry.

Sadly, shortly after the first class enrolled in 1946, Philip Schutz passed away. Theodore Vermeulen (PhD, UCLA) joined the program in February 1947 and became its head.

https://eps.berkeley.edu/about/department-chairs-letter,"We are the UC Berkeley Department of Earth & Planetary Science. The first class in geology at Berkeley was offered in 1868, thus marking the incipient year of the founding of a world-class public university. In 1892, Andrew Lawson led students up the Berkeley Hills, beginning the first systematic field geology course in North America, a course we continue to teach (EPS 101). And the extensive report on the great San Francisco earthquake in 1906 led by Lawson is by many considered to represent the birth of modern earthquake science. More than a century later, a legacy of excellent teaching and scholarly inquiry drives all members of our department.",49.55,11.7,14.0,13.83,13.2,11.37,10.41,13.2,29,5,108,0.8316,Positive

The Chronicle of Higher Education ranks our department as the best in scholarly faculty productivity, and the American Geosciences Institute finds that the department produces the second largest number of Earth Science faculty in US universities, despite being only ½ to ⅓ the size of our peers. I am proud that nine of my colleagues are members of the National Academy of Sciences, including three female faculty members.

Through research, you will strengthen your physics background knowledge by applying it to real problems and develop crucial skills needed for careers in science and industry, such as collaboration, independent problem-solving, and communication. Though your role will vary from lab to lab, as an undergraduate, you can typically expect to assist with a variety of tasks, ranging from simulation and data analysis to operating and tuning lab equipment. While the idea of engaging in cutting-edge research as a college student may seem daunting, many research groups will organize projects specifically tailored to undergraduates, and you will often be put under the mentorship of a senior graduate student or a postdoctoral scholar who will be more than willing to assist you.

https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-research,"As a freshman coming into UC Berkeley with no previous experience in research or astronomy, I joined ULAB, after learning about it in my physics class, and had my first research experience working on determining cosmic distances from gravitational waves, previously knowing nothing on the topic. The same year, I took the Python for Astronomers DeCal, and did a project on creating Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for several star clusters. After these two introductory experiences, I felt more confident in my abilities as a researcher, and attended the physics and astronomy research fairs at the start of each semester of my sophomore year. From the fair, I emailed one of the presenters, and subsequently got my position working under Antonella Palmese and Saul Perlmutter on gravitational wave cosmology. Having started this position in the spring, I decided to apply for the Pi2 scholars summer program, and was accepted to the program to work with Antonella as my mentor, continuing the work we started in the spring. I also joined ULAB staff as a lab manager in my sophomore year, and I am now research director for the DeCal, helping other undergraduates get their first research experience like I once did.

https://psychology.berkeley.edu/about,"In 1921-2, in keeping with a growing trend across the nation, Berkeley’s Department of Psychology was established as a separate unit, emerging from the Department of Philosophy. For nearly a century, the department has been a national and international leader in psychological research and the superior educational programs that we have provided to undergraduates and doctoral students.The Psychology Department moved to Tolman Hall in 1963 when it was a new state-of-the-art building. This building served us well for over 50 years, but alas, the nature of our work has changed and our beloved Tolman Hall was no longer quite as state-of-the-art. In June 2018, we moved to a new building at the corner of Berkeley Way and Shattuck. We look forward to another 50 years of continuing our cutting edge research, excellent clinical services, and renowned teaching and advising of undergraduate and PhD students.Today, our award winning faculty conduct ground-breaking research in many areas of psychology, including behavioral and systems neuroscience, clinical science, cognition, cognitive neuroscience, development, social, and personality. Our PhD students go on to exciting careers in academia (e.g. Yale, Stanford, UCLA), industry (e.g., Facebook, Google), healthcare (e.g., Oakland Children’s Hospital, Seattle VA) and policy (e.g., National Institute of Justice).",37.5,12.2,14.3,12.46,14.2,14.21,10.88,17.5,58,12,202,0.9723,Positive
