Having been a prospective mathematics and economics major with a business minor, one of the most important factors I was considering was the opportunity to gain one-on-one contact with my professors throughout my college experience. This led me to choosing UCSD, and I was definitely not disappointed. Through coffee with professors, office hours, and many honors series offered to students interested in Economics, UCSD offers a wide array of opportunities to get to know one’s professors and gain mentorship and guidance from them. With the many business organizations offered here at UCSD, I quickly joined the Undergraduate Economics Society, of which I am now President of, as well Women in Business. These organizations have helped me pursue my passions for female empowerment and business simultaneously. Through resources and guidance of remarkable math and economic staff members here at UCSD, who I have worked closely with, I have landed amazing internship opportunities, including at the start-up Portfolium, Inc., Porsche Consulting Group in Germany, and Geico. Currently, I am in the process of applying to numerous PhD in Economics Programs, along with Master Programs in Applied Mathematics.

Also, since it usually takes years for the latest research findings to make their way to undergraduate textbooks, I keep students up-to-date on the latest research findings. I also give them insight into why policy-makers are pursuing particular policies. For example, I have known the former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke since I was a graduate student and am well-acquainted with his research.

This residential energy expenditure gap persists after controlling for income, household size, home-owner status, and city of residence. It decreased but did not disappear between 2010 and 2017, and it is fairly stable in levels across the income distribution, except at the top. Controlling for home type or vintage does not eliminate the gap, but survey evidence on housing characteristics and available appliances is consistent with the gap being driven at least in part by differences in housing stock and related energy efficiency investments.This seminar series is put on by the UC Berkeley Rausser College of Natural Resources (RCNR) and the Berkeley Environmental Economics and Policy Students (BEEPS).RSVP for this event via CalLinkfor the Zoom Information!https://callink.berkeley.edu/event/6564959",30.7,14.8,57,8,188,0.9544,0.13636363636363635

Research is not just for students who want to go on to graduate school or want to become scientists. You can pursue research to learn how to solve problems, to put into practice what you are learning in your courses, to explore things at the cutting edge. You learn to pay attention to details because results must be reproducible.  There are many opportunities for doing research beyond the bounds of Integrative Biology and many ways to find funding for your research.

https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-research,UC Berkeley,Physics,Undergraduate Research,Y,2:26,"Our department provides a variety of channels for students to get involved with real scientific research early in their careers. Through research, you will strengthen your physics background knowledge by applying it to real problems and develop crucial skills needed for careers in science and industry, such as collaboration, independent problem-solving, and communication. Though your role will vary from lab to lab, as an undergraduate, you can typically expect to assist with a variety of tasks, ranging from simulation and data analysis to operating and tuning lab equipment. While the idea of engaging in cutting-edge research as a college student may seem daunting, many research groups will organize projects specifically tailored to undergraduates, and you will often be put under the mentorship of a senior graduate student or a postdoctoral scholar who will be more than willing to assist you. Overall, participating in undergraduate research is an extremely fulfilling experience, and we highly encourage you to participate in it!",22.28,18.1,53,5,159,0.7082,0.14702380952380953

The same year, I took the Python for Astronomers DeCal, and did a project on creating Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for several star clusters. After these two introductory experiences, I felt more confident in my abilities as a researcher, and attended the physics and astronomy research fairs at the start of each semester of my sophomore year. From the fair, I emailed one of the presenters, and subsequently got my position working under Antonella Palmese and Saul Perlmutter on gravitational wave cosmology. Having started this position in the spring, I decided to apply for the Pi2 scholars summer program, and was accepted to the program to work with Antonella as my mentor, continuing the work we started in the spring. I also joined ULAB staff as a lab manager in my sophomore year, and I am now research director for the DeCal, helping other undergraduates get their first research experience like I once did. The various opportunities offered by the Physics and Astronomy departments helped expose me to all these research experiences, and allowed me to improve and grow greatly from when I arrived at Berkeley to now.",37.88,16.2,53,7,232,0.9476,0.21474358974358973

https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/meet-rausser-advisors#nst-advisor,UC Berkeley,Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology,Advising,Y,1:15,"I am an East Bay native that grew up in the Hayward-Fremont area. I went to the University of California, Irvine where I received my bachelor’s in Psychology and Social Behavior and minor in Criminology, Law, and Society. I always wanted to work with young people in a counseling capacity, so I pursued a career in school counseling. While applying for masters programs I worked as a Teaching Aide for middle school Spanish at a K-8 private school in Orange County as well as an Afterschool Teacher for the local YMCA. I attended the University of San Diego (the one on the hill) to receive my master’s in Counseling, specialization School Counseling.",48.74,12.0,30,5,112,0.2732,0.011904761904761906
https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/meet-rausser-advisors#nst-advisor,UC Berkeley,Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology,Advising,Y,1:15,"My experience with higher education began at Irvine. While there, I worked for a time at the housing office as a Center Attendant – managing the front desk of the main office, mailing office, and recreation centers. During my master’s program, I worked as an Office Assistant at the student affairs office for USD’s Law School. Working there while training to be a school counselor I noticed many similarities between the responsibilities of the academic advisors and what I was trained to do as a school counselor. After graduating with my counseling degree I returned to the Bay Area and worked as a K-8 Counselor for a public school in Dublin. While I enjoyed the lively and energetic environment of being a school counselor, my mind would think back to my experience at USD Law School and how many of my passions as a counselor fit better in that setting. It is here in 2022 that I return to the higher education environment to utilize my skills in identifying students’ strengths and interests to support their pursuit of a college education and career that fulfills them! Especially since college can be a major life experience, I want to assist students in having a holistic view of how to enjoy their time – academically and socially.",44.48,13.7,45,8,213,0.9816,0.22954545454545455

Through research, you will strengthen your physics background knowledge by applying it to real problems and develop crucial skills needed for careers in science and industry, such as collaboration, independent problem-solving, and communication. Though your role will vary from lab to lab, as an undergraduate, you can typically expect to assist with a variety of tasks, ranging from simulation and data analysis to operating and tuning lab equipment. While the idea of engaging in cutting-edge research as a college student may seem daunting, many research groups will organize projects specifically tailored to undergraduates, and you will often be put under the mentorship of a senior graduate student or a postdoctoral scholar who will be more than willing to assist you.

The same year, I took the Python for Astronomers DeCal, and did a project on creating Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for several star clusters. After these two introductory experiences, I felt more confident in my abilities as a researcher, and attended the physics and astronomy research fairs at the start of each semester of my sophomore year. From the fair, I emailed one of the presenters, and subsequently got my position working under Antonella Palmese and Saul Perlmutter on gravitational wave cosmology. Having started this position in the spring, I decided to apply for the Pi2 scholars summer program, and was accepted to the program to work with Antonella as my mentor, continuing the work we started in the spring. I also joined ULAB staff as a lab manager in my sophomore year, and I am now research director for the DeCal, helping other undergraduates get their first research experience like I once did. The various opportunities offered by the Physics and Astronomy departments helped expose me to all these research experiences, and allowed me to improve and grow greatly from when I arrived at Berkeley to now.",37.88,16.2,53,7,232,0.9476,0.21474358974358973

This year-long endeavor (normally spanning the three academic quarters of your Senior year) involves conducting research under the mentorship of a faculty member. Senior thesis students generate hypotheses, collect new data, perform analyses, interpret their findings, and write a senior thesis manuscript which they submit to the department. They meet regularly as a cohort of distinguished scholars to hone research and science communication skills. At the end of the year, the scholars present their findings to the entire department in a celebratory poster session.

Again this will also provide more opportunities for undergraduate research. In this track, students will take Math 2A-B along with an approved third quarter during the first year. This requires taking separate lower division writing and the approved alternatives to the Humanities Core. These approved alternatives can be completed the third (or even fourth) year along with other breadth requirements. An accelerated track will be required for those wishing to complete joint majors with Chemistry since these students will need to start the Physics 7 series during the second year.",45.25,11.3,29,8,140,0.9741,0.13359375

We are proud to be one of the largest chemistry programs in the country, with more than 100 chemistry majors graduating every year. Our graduates are in great demand by the employers because they value the rigor and quality of our program. There is a broad spectrum of exciting careers open to people with a UCI chemistry degree because chemistry directly affects all aspects of modern life. The clothing we wear, the food we eat, the cell phones we use to communicate with each other, the gasoline we put in our cars, and millions of other things we take for granted would not exist without chemists.
