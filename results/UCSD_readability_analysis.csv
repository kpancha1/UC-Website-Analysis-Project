Having been a prospective mathematics and economics major with a business minor, one of the most important factors I was considering was the opportunity to gain one-on-one contact with my professors throughout my college experience. This led me to choosing UCSD, and I was definitely not disappointed. Through coffee with professors, office hours, and many honors series offered to students interested in Economics, UCSD offers a wide array of opportunities to get to know one’s professors and gain mentorship and guidance from them. With the many business organizations offered here at UCSD, I quickly joined the Undergraduate Economics Society, of which I am now President of, as well Women in Business. These organizations have helped me pursue my passions for female empowerment and business simultaneously. Through resources and guidance of remarkable math and economic staff members here at UCSD, who I have worked closely with, I have landed amazing internship opportunities, including at the start-up Portfolium, Inc., Porsche Consulting Group in Germany, and Geico. Currently, I am in the process of applying to numerous PhD in Economics Programs, along with Master Programs in Applied Mathematics.

I also give them insight into why policy-makers are pursuing particular policies. For example, I have known the former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke since I was a graduate student and am well-acquainted with his research.
