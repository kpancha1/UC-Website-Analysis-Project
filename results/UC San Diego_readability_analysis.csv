Finally, such an education should incorporate participation in the production process itself.The department stages three theatrical productions per year featuring the work of undergraduate actors, designers, and stage managers. The department also produces two dance concerts yearly, one of which showcases student choreographers. In addition, undergraduates have the opportunity to audition for graduate shows, including those directed by prestigious guest artists. Two cabaret spaces are also available almost every weekend during the school year for students to conceive and stage their own work. Theatre majors get a free ticket to every department show.",31.72,14.4,49,8,180,0.8934,0.11513157894736842

Now working in the banking industry and looking back, I am grateful for all the hard-core and soft skills I’ve developed working in collaborative settings in class and giving presentations.

https://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/prospective-student-info/index.html,Prospective students,"""Three years ago, I was deciding between several colleges that I could potentially go to. Having been a prospective mathematics and economics major with a business minor, one of the most important factors I was considering was the opportunity to gain one-on-one contact with my professors throughout my college experience. This led me to choosing UCSD, and I was definitely not disappointed. Through coffee with professors, office hours, and many honors series offered to students interested in Economics, UCSD offers a wide array of opportunities to get to know one’s professors and gain mentorship and guidance from them. With the many business organizations offered here at UCSD, I quickly joined the Undergraduate Economics Society, of which I am now President of, as well Women in Business. These organizations have helped me pursue my passions for female empowerment and business simultaneously. Through resources and guidance of remarkable math and economic staff members here at UCSD, who I have worked closely with, I have landed amazing internship opportunities, including at the start-up Portfolium, Inc., Porsche Consulting Group in Germany, and Geico. Currently, I am in the process of applying to numerous PhD in Economics Programs, along with Master Programs in Applied Mathematics. My campus involvements along with the conversations I have held with my professors have been very valuable pieces to my experiences at UCSD and in determining what path I want to take in my life!""",39.16,13.6,58,10,235,0.9917,0.2335416666666667

I also give them insight into why policy-makers are pursuing particular policies. For example, I have known the former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke since I was a graduate student and am well-acquainted with his research. Thus, I can explain to students why the Fed responds so vigorously to credit problems.

https://eds.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/research.html,Undergraduate Research,"Our ClassInSight research team is developing and studying an application that can be used to support teacher reflection and learning. This application provides visualizations of classroom data to teachers that can help them to reflect on their facilitation of rich scientific discussion in middle and high school classrooms. Making sense of these visualizations (representations of open and close-ended questions, student and teacher dialogue, and more), teachers refine their teaching and consider how to best prepare students to construct explanations and design solutions and engage in argument from evidence. Overall, teachers use the app to reflect, learn more about strategies for facilitating science discussions, and plan future lessons with these strategies in mind. This year, we are using teacher voices and feedback to shape the design of the application described above. We are looking for passionate, curious, and organized undergraduate collaborators to contribute to this effort. Our undergraduate researchers will be essential in the effort to collect, process, and analyze the data we collect this year (classroom observations, interviews with teachers, and focus group sessions). This project is led by PI Dr. Sherice Clarke. As a team member, you will be a part of our lab and will have access to lab meetings and mentorship that will connect you with a wonderful network of other undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and senior researchers.

https://literature.ucsd.edu/ugrad/prospective.html,Undergraduate Research,"""The thing I love about UCSD's literature/writing major is that the program gives you a lot of space to figure out your interests. There are so many genres available for you to explore. You can take a class in experiemental cross genre work or science fiction and fantasy. You can write epic poems. You can do whatever you need to do to grow as a writer.  The program is also situated within a larger literature department, so there's an understanding of the connection between reading deeply and writing deeply and you have access to all these amazing literature classes while you're taking writing workshops. For instance, I was able to take a world mythology class which gave me a deeper understanding of the archetypes I was using in my poems when I made mythological references. Also, the teachers are working writers passionate about their craft and that shows in the way they teach. I really enjoyed my time in the program.""",61.77,9.1,35,9,161,0.9516,0.23942307692307693
