All UC Berkeley students are invited to attend!Black households have higher residential energy expenditures than white households in the US. This residential energy expenditure gap persists after controlling for income, household size, home-owner status, and city of residence. It decreased but did not disappear between 2010 and 2017, and it is fairly stable in levels across the income distribution, except at the top. Controlling for home type or vintage does not eliminate the gap, but survey evidence on housing characteristics and available appliances is consistent with the gap being driven at least in part by differences in housing stock and related energy efficiency investments.This seminar series is put on by the UC Berkeley Rausser College of Natural Resources (RCNR) and the Berkeley Environmental Economics and Policy Students (BEEPS).RSVP for this event via CalLinkfor the Zoom Information!https://callink.berkeley.edu/event/6564959",30.7,14.8,57,8,188,0.9544,0.13636363636363635

Research is not just for students who want to go on to graduate school or want to become scientists. You can pursue research to learn how to solve problems, to put into practice what you are learning in your courses, to explore things at the cutting edge. You learn to pay attention to details because results must be reproducible.  There are many opportunities for doing research beyond the bounds of Integrative Biology and many ways to find funding for your research.

https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-research,UC Berkeley,Physics,Undergraduate Research,Y,2:26,"Our department provides a variety of channels for students to get involved with real scientific research early in their careers. Through research, you will strengthen your physics background knowledge by applying it to real problems and develop crucial skills needed for careers in science and industry, such as collaboration, independent problem-solving, and communication. Though your role will vary from lab to lab, as an undergraduate, you can typically expect to assist with a variety of tasks, ranging from simulation and data analysis to operating and tuning lab equipment. While the idea of engaging in cutting-edge research as a college student may seem daunting, many research groups will organize projects specifically tailored to undergraduates, and you will often be put under the mentorship of a senior graduate student or a postdoctoral scholar who will be more than willing to assist you. Overall, participating in undergraduate research is an extremely fulfilling experience, and we highly encourage you to participate in it!",22.28,18.1,53,5,159,0.7082,0.14702380952380953

The same year, I took the Python for Astronomers DeCal, and did a project on creating Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for several star clusters. After these two introductory experiences, I felt more confident in my abilities as a researcher, and attended the physics and astronomy research fairs at the start of each semester of my sophomore year. From the fair, I emailed one of the presenters, and subsequently got my position working under Antonella Palmese and Saul Perlmutter on gravitational wave cosmology. Having started this position in the spring, I decided to apply for the Pi2 scholars summer program, and was accepted to the program to work with Antonella as my mentor, continuing the work we started in the spring. I also joined ULAB staff as a lab manager in my sophomore year, and I am now research director for the DeCal, helping other undergraduates get their first research experience like I once did. The various opportunities offered by the Physics and Astronomy departments helped expose me to all these research experiences, and allowed me to improve and grow greatly from when I arrived at Berkeley to now.",37.88,16.2,53,7,232,0.9476,0.21474358974358973

During my master’s program, I worked as an Office Assistant at the student affairs office for USD’s Law School. Working there while training to be a school counselor I noticed many similarities between the responsibilities of the academic advisors and what I was trained to do as a school counselor. After graduating with my counseling degree I returned to the Bay Area and worked as a K-8 Counselor for a public school in Dublin. While I enjoyed the lively and energetic environment of being a school counselor, my mind would think back to my experience at USD Law School and how many of my passions as a counselor fit better in that setting. It is here in 2022 that I return to the higher education environment to utilize my skills in identifying students’ strengths and interests to support their pursuit of a college education and career that fulfills them!

Through research, you will strengthen your physics background knowledge by applying it to real problems and develop crucial skills needed for careers in science and industry, such as collaboration, independent problem-solving, and communication. Though your role will vary from lab to lab, as an undergraduate, you can typically expect to assist with a variety of tasks, ranging from simulation and data analysis to operating and tuning lab equipment. While the idea of engaging in cutting-edge research as a college student may seem daunting, many research groups will organize projects specifically tailored to undergraduates, and you will often be put under the mentorship of a senior graduate student or a postdoctoral scholar who will be more than willing to assist you.

The same year, I took the Python for Astronomers DeCal, and did a project on creating Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for several star clusters. After these two introductory experiences, I felt more confident in my abilities as a researcher, and attended the physics and astronomy research fairs at the start of each semester of my sophomore year. From the fair, I emailed one of the presenters, and subsequently got my position working under Antonella Palmese and Saul Perlmutter on gravitational wave cosmology. Having started this position in the spring, I decided to apply for the Pi2 scholars summer program, and was accepted to the program to work with Antonella as my mentor, continuing the work we started in the spring. I also joined ULAB staff as a lab manager in my sophomore year, and I am now research director for the DeCal, helping other undergraduates get their first research experience like I once did. The various opportunities offered by the Physics and Astronomy departments helped expose me to all these research experiences, and allowed me to improve and grow greatly from when I arrived at Berkeley to now.",37.88,16.2,53,7,232,0.9476,0.21474358974358973
