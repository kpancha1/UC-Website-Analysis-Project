https://es.ucsb.edu/undergradresearch,UCSB,Environmental Studies,Undergraduate Research,Y,1:40.72,The Independent Studies course (ENV S 199) is available every quarter. This variable unit upper-division course is available to students who have a specific topic of interest they would like to research in-depth under the supervision of an Environmental Studies faculty member. The intent of this course is to allow students to investigate a topic covered in a recently completed course in which they would like to learn more about. Environmental Studies will try to accommodate Independent Studies proposals as long as they are supported by a faculty member and the research to be conducted is environmental (see the official course description for restrictions).,36.63,14.6,25,4,104,0.8807,0.15625

If you both agree on the project, then pick up an official ENV S 199 proposal contract, have it signed by your faculty advisor, and return it to the Environmental Studies Academic Coordinator before the end of the 3rd week of the quarter.",26.98,18.3,18,2,71,0.7717,0.1

https://es.ucsb.edu/undergradresearch,UCSB,Environmental Studies,Undergraduate Research,Y,1:40.72,The Research Assistant course (ENV S 199RA) is designed just like the 199 course. The difference is that the main focus of this course is to allow a student to obtain academic credit while assisting an Environmental Studies faculty member in conducting university research. This is a great way for an undergraduate to pick up research experience and learn more about a given environmental field.,49.45,11.8,16,3,65,0.8779,0.3666666666666667
